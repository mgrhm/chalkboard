    <h2>
        Ontological and Corporeal Lassitude
    </h2>

<p class="post-tags">Tagged as: <a href="apple" class="post-tags-link">apple</a>,

<a href="apple" class="post-tags-link">link to the past</a></p>

  <p>Actually, an iPad Mini would fit quite well into my
  life.</p>

  <p>Case Study: Bed, lying down. My iPhone 5 is a tad small
  and tall for Comixology (currently entombing Terry Moore’s
  <em>Echo</em>). Reading in bed —lying down— the iPad 2 is a
  bit unwieldy and the MacBook, while it is by no means a
  scorching hot, nor does it sound like a cheap and nasty leaf
  blower coughing up a reeking oily lung; it does get heavy. I
  would worry about dropping it on myself as I fall asleep, or
  worse; it sliding off my corporeal lassitude, over a teflonic
  cotton sea, and <em>Baam!</em> Onto the floor.
  <em>Hurruck</em>, churns a great few empathic readers’
  stomachs.</p>

  <p>It is hard to subscribe rigidly to only one philosophy
  when you read into ontology, epistemology, axiology and
  consider the different stances and branches you can grip.
  Stepping outside your comfort zone and the seemingly
  frictionless network of deeply carved, raw and tender
  pathways in your mind.</p>

  <p>Instead, give these bleeding, searing trails a rest. Let
  healing take place from a remove. Enlarging the horizon of
  possible, allowable thoughts from new and alien perspectives
  is uncomfortable. You hate something because you cannot
  access it in your mind, and you cannot make the journey to
  reconcile this. You have no capacity to even release that
  there exists another way. Or do you? Screeching in.</p>

  <p>Scar tissue forms when tender roots are spreading beyond a
  link to the past. Tender roots are fragile. Nurtured by a
  thirst for knowledge, an open-minded curiosity towards
  appraising many approaches, and the will to suffer the fresh
  pain of living in these roots as they die or thrive in the
  battle against the concrete that is our own stubborn
  preconceptions and limitations; breaking through a new plane
  to breed seeds of hope. Pollinating, only then, gnarled trees
  of hard-won experiences; together, not alone. Vulnerable
  still to diseases and abuses from proximal beings and
  poisonous feedings.</p>

  <p>Now I think about it again. An iPhone is just dandy
  dander. Compressed like carbon in the fabrication of
  artificial diamonds. No, that’s not right. Dander with a
  latent film of smug yuppie pore excreta, smearing and
  swirling invisible, till the lights go down.</p>

  <p>But in fact, I wrote and edited (thirty/seventy split) all
  this while lying in bed, tapping my thumbs onto a foil of
  glass, the busiest section four postage stamps wide, two
  tall, and promising to realise all dreams, with so much
  potential, until next year’s new model steals eyeballs and
  bile again.</p>
